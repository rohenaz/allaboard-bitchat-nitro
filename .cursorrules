# ABILITY: Self Learning
As you learn key facts about the project, update .cursorrules with new rules.
# Bun
use bun always instead of npm or yarn

# Strategy
- Do not assume, CHECK!
- modern is better, simple is better
- work on specifically the task requested
- make suggestions of improvements, but dont implement them without confirmation

# Last Known Good State
Last known good commit: f765eefcf95e090b13fa36cce2f5c36ea2c7bba7
- frequently check the last known good state of files at the provided commit hash to make sure we haven't broken anything

You can query files from the last known good state using:
1. View file contents: `git show f765eefcf95e090b13fa36cce2f5c36ea2c7bba7:path/to/file | cat`
2. List changed files: `git diff --name-only f765eefcf95e090b13fa36cce2f5c36ea2c7bba7`
3. View specific changes: `git diff f765eefcf95e090b13fa36cce2f5c36ea2c7bba7 path/to/file`
4. Check file history: `git log -p f765eefcf95e090b13fa36cce2f5c36ea2c7bba7 path/to/file`

# Linting
bun lint

# BSV Libraries
npm: use @bsv/sdk instead of bsv
npm: use bsv-bap for BAP functionality

# Code rules
- use bun instead of npm or yarn
- use regular fetch for outside of components, tanstack query when inside components and never axios
- use for loops instead of forEach
- react: never import * as React from 'react';
- react: dont import React just to use it as a type: React.FC - instead just import FC
- only import type unless you need to use it as a value

# Reviewing Target Commit
When reviewing code from target commit f765eefcf95e090b13fa36cce2f5c36ea2c7bba7:
1. Use `git show f765eefcf95e090b13fa36cce2f5c36ea2c7bba7:path/to/file` to view old file versions
2. Check both .js and .tsx/.ts extensions as files may have been renamed
3. Compare implementations to restore critical functionality
4. Focus on core features: authentication, channels, messaging
5. Note key differences in state management and API handling

# Auth
- handcash returns from oauth with something like this: https://bitchatnitro.com/?authToken=<some_token >
- we extract the token from the url and use it to login
